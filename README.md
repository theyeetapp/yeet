### Yeet

------------
So I consider myself financial market curious. I like to at least be in the know about the latest happenings in the stock/crypto market. There a bunch of companies/cryptos that I take particular interest in. So I thought to turn it into a fun project to build. 

I built Yeet along with its accompanying Telegram bot, [YeetBot](https://github.com/olamileke/yeetbot "YeetBot") to deliver stock and crypto price notifications every morning at 8am GMT +1. Yeet is a Laravel monolith while YeetBot is written in Python via the Python Telegram Bot library.

Access the live application at [https://theyeetapp.com](https://theyeetapp.com "https://theyeetapp.com").
